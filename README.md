# Trading Journal

A structured trading journal powered by AI to help traders review decisions, track behavior, and improve consistency — not just P&L.

## Why this exists

Most traders don’t fail because of strategy.
They fail because they **repeat the same mistakes without noticing**.

This project is built to:
- Record trades with proper context
- Analyze decision-making patterns using AI
- Turn subjective trading behavior into objective feedback

If you’re serious about improving as a trader, journaling isn’t optional — this tool is built to make it unavoidable.

## What this app does

- 📒 Log trades with reasoning, emotions, and outcomes
- 🤖 Use Gemini AI to analyze trades and behavior patterns
- 📊 Highlight recurring mistakes and strengths
- 🧠 Encourage post-trade reflection instead of impulsive trading
- ⚡ Fast, minimal UI focused on usability, not noise

This is **not** a signal app.  
It’s a mirror.

## Philosophy

- You don’t improve by trading more.
- You improve by reviewing better.

If this journal makes you uncomfortable sometimes, it’s doing its job.
