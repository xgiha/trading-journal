# Trading Journal

A structured trading journal powered by AI to help traders review decisions, track behavior, and improve consistency — not just P&L.

## Why this exists

Most traders don’t fail because of strategy.
They fail because they **repeat the same mistakes without noticing**.

This project is built to:
- Record trades with proper context
- Analyze decision-making patterns using AI
- Turn subjective trading behavior into objective feedback

If you’re serious about improving as a trader, journaling isn’t optional — this tool is built to make it unavoidable.

This is **not** a signal app.  
It’s a mirror.
